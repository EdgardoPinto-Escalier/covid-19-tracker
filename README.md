#   COVID-19 TRACKER
##  COVID-19 Tracker made using ReactJS

This web application has been created to make it easier for me to visualize data country by country. This data is fetched from an external API and 3 different cards has been created to dispaly stats as well as 2 different charts (1 Bar Chart and 1 Linear Chart). This project has been created using the latest JavaScript syntax. 

It also uses different resources such as: 

- Material UI
- Charts.js, 
- React Hooks
- API data fetching

This web application gets live data from the following [public API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) using Async/Await syntax.
